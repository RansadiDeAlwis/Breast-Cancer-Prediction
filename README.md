# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

### Description: 
This project aims to build a predictive model to diagnose breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The goal is to assist medical professionals in making accurate and timely decisions by predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on input features. The model is trained using neural networks taken from a dataset in Kaggle and outputs whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
